This was an application available on both android and as a web app.
The application was developed to improve the current experience getting prescription medication.
The app allowed a patient to take a photo of their prescription and send it to a pharmacy of their choice. This pharmacy could then prepare the medication and update the status so the patient is able follow the status of their prescription and once the prescription was ready for pick up the patient would get a text notification. In addition to the technology stack given below, during my project I made use of: Scrum, JavaScript, Maven, Github, android studio, Firebase, Google Maps and Twilio.

#### **Technology Stack**

- Pharmacy webapp - React JS
- Patient Mobile App - Android Java
- Shared REST API - Spring Boot
- Database - MySQL

This is a web application I developed for use by my friends. Was built with ReactJS, hosted by AWS Amplify. It is connected to firebase real-time database as well as Firebase Storage for storing images. The website contains player stats and stores planned events and has event countdown timer.

#### **Friend Manager**

I made this application in java for Android.
It allows user to store the names and numbers of friends in a list stored in an SQLite database.
Users can add new friends, find friends by searching their name or number and view all friends in a recyclerview.
